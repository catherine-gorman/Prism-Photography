You’re going to build a company homepage for a real or imagined company. You should include:

1) A title and logo or splash image.
2) A mission statement or brief description of the company.
3) A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
4) A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.

A great source for project images when you’re practicing web design is Unsplash.
